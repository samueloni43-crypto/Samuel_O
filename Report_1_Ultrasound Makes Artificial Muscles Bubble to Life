Ultrasound Makes Artificial Muscles Bubble to Life

Researchers at ETH ZÃ¼rich have developed a new type of artificial muscle powered by ultrasound. This innovative material, filled with microscopic bubbles, behaves like a natural muscle when activated by sound waves, contracting and gripping. Unlike traditional artificial muscles that rely on wires or hydraulics, these "bubble muscles" offer wireless control, quick responsiveness, and potential medical applications such as soft robots, surgical tools, and drug delivery systems. The technology has shown promise in prototype devices, including a soft robot inspired by a stingray and a delicate gripper, but further testing is needed to evaluate its performance in living organisms. The ability to track bubbles using standard ultrasound imaging provides a unique advantage for medical applications.
